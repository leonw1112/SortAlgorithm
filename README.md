# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This repository contains C++ code that implements several sorting algorithms. You can use these algorithms to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The available sorting algorithms are:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the code, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- A text file named `list.txt` containing a list of integers to be sorted (one integer per line)

### Compilation

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located. Use the following command to compile the code:

```bash
g++ -o sortingAlgorithms main.cpp
